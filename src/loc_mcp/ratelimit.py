"""Request pacing that holds across processes.

An in-process limiter was sufficient while the only caller was a long-lived MCP
server handling one request at a time. It is not sufficient now: each CLI
invocation is a separate process with its own limiter, and callers are expected
to fan work out across several at once. Pacing therefore has to live somewhere
both processes can see - a small state file guarded by an exclusive lock.

Unlike ANNO and DDB, the Library of Congress **publishes** its limit: 20 requests
per minute, and exceeding it blocks the IP for a full hour. That penalty is what
sets the default here. Twenty a minute is one every three seconds exactly, which
leaves no headroom at all for clock skew or for a burst arriving from two
processes that both just passed the lock, so the default is four seconds - about
fifteen a minute. Losing a quarter of the throughput is cheap; losing an hour
mid-research is not.

Unix only; `fcntl` has no Windows equivalent here.
